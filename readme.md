#fylo front end

This website is inpired by a design from front end mentor,its developed using HTML and CSS,no library is used.

the website is responsive for 1200px and above and 500px and down for now,will eep on working on it
. i wont say that website is pixel perfect , as i tried to copy design from eye observations rather than using some tool like figma or adobe to make it pixel perfect.
will learn and start using these tools soon
